## Doing the Jekyll, Doing the Haskell

Ok, working through some of the basics of Jeykll. I don't have any need to develop a full site here, but instead just use it as a place to collect my thoughts. And to develop the habit of collecting my thoughts.

Currently, I'm reading "Haskell Programming from First Principles". My overall goal is to work backend in data, but I may have to get there through the front end. I've spent some years working with HTML, Bootstrap, Wordpress, CSS and the like, but never really headed into the programming end until about 8 months ago. And the 8 months have flown by! I love thinking in code and solving wicked problems. So, Here is my direction.

* Functional Programming Foundation with Haskell
* Full Stack Django or Flask (I already know some python)
* Explore Javascript (it's functional means, it's backend, React)
* And finally get up to date on CSS and HTML tech

I know it looks like I'm going backwards from the usual curriculum. That's on purpose. I've done plenty of CSS and HTML, or least enough to bore me too much if I try to start there again. Because most classes assume no knowledge, that first week of any training would kill the momentum I feel when learning more challenging programming techniques.

### Functional Programming Foundation with Haskell

The purpose of this direction isn't to use Haskell as a language for any major projects, but instead to establish a form of problem solving that I can pull from. From the reading I've done and a few talks I've watched, this method has promise. If I end up not working in Haskell, that's ok. I just want to have the ability to think about problem solving in a functional manner and be able to recognize the problems it can solve.

This post is little confused, but I don't have any deep insight to report yet. Just a statement of intent.

I intend to learn and apply as much as I can.
