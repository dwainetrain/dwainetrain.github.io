More progress with the TDD goat today. Now that my errors are conforming with Harry's, I'm in much clearer waters. Over the weekend I had a little fun with the Electron application framework, and I think it's really cool. Fun in a way that's worth exploring more. My mind is abuzz with many app ideas, we'll see which one I settle on when I swing around and try a JS app in August. I'm thinking of somehow tying it into a python/django backend and creating an incremental reading type app, since supermemo has been updated since 2000 (egads!).

That's all for now. Just engraining this habit of writing, and then onto engraining the habit of keeping good working notes so that my posts can be a little more in depth.

Cheers!
