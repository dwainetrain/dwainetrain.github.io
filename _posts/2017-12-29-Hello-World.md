A quick fork of a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) theme and I'm ready to go. I have Barry Clark to thank for his excellent article[article](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/). Now onto to the exciting horizon.

I'll dig deeper into customizing this blog as time progresses. Gotta get my Markdown chops into shape though.

To whomever is listening, Cheers!
