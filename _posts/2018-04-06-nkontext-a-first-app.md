## Deciding on My First App: nKontext

While I've made many websites, I've never really created an app. That's about to change. Yesterday while doing some repetitive tasks in my Japanese learning it dawned on me that repititve tasks are exactly one of the things an app is good for. So, I started testing out some of my ideas and put them into play in a jupyter notebook. It's still very rough, but the idea is there.

The basics: Searching through Japanese tv shows that have subtitles for a specific word so that you can see if used in context. The main reason for this is that so often at this beginner intermediate stage of learning Japanese, I learn alot of things out of context, or in a shallow context. Meaning, the senses aren't engaged and it just kind of feels like a word or concept sitting out in a void. When you find native Japanese speakers using it, especially with the structure of a story around it, you become more invested in the use of the word or structure. It suddenly becomes unforgetable.

With that in mind it doesn't seem too difficult to bring up a batch of subtitles and their corresponding videos and search through them, then using HTML5 to display and jump to the specific location where the word you're searching for appears. With matching english subtitles too, this becomes a really useful tool. At least, I've been using the same idea manually for months now.

Now on to actually building it though. I plan python in background and electron for the front end. I think videos are too large and unwieldy for mobile right now, so this more for people that have collections of such things. Maybe later I'll be able to accomplish something like Delvin or Supernative, which I've also been using in this fashion.

What those lacked were coverage. Not only was vocabulary missing, but word conjunctions and inflections were overlooked, and grammar was untouched. I'm hoping to create something that helps reinforce those things, not add to the pile of them. Because what's the use of 1000s of new vocabulary if you can't keep it in mind?

That's all for now. Time to fire up my Django studies and get back to work.
