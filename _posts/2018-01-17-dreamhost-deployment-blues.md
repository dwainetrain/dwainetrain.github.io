## Going Server Side

Since I've been spending today's development time just playing with the dreamhost servers, I don't have much to commit to github. Thus, to keep this record going, and keep the chain unbroken, a blog post is in order.

A quick update: I've reached the point in TDD Obey the Goat where it's time to learn about deploying the django app to the server. Well, as you would expect, the environment I use is different from the one Harry uses in the book. Of critical importance is the difference in servers, I have apache to deal with and Harry is giving instructions for nginx. I think dreamhost would allow me to setup nginx, but first I want to try the apache route. Yesterday evening and this morning have been spent trying to mash the books instructions together with the dreamhost instructions. The result was a brick instead of a loaf of bread. Mainly, I was able to get so far, but never get the browser to pull up the Django page. So, this evening I'm just smelting the whole site down and going through the Dreamhost only django motions to at least get a success page. Then I'll try to bring the superlists app into the fold.

That's all for now, I'm going to track some of the more esoteric routes as I need to take them to complete this process.
